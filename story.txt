Joe was such a good baseball player that he made it all the way to major league baseball.
His dream was to win a world series, the world championship of baseball. This would be hard
though as a young talent needing to help his teammates get better as well.

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away... Nah that's not it. 
My name is Jeff, I'm 18 years old, and I just got drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the 2027 NBA draft. As you may know, the Bulls
have never been the same since Michael Jordan left. The only thing they got that was closest to replicating the success Michael
brought to the city of Chicago was Derrick Rose, but injuries plagued his career, and so the Bulls never saw a championship ever
since Michael Jordan left. Bulls fans never thought they would witness greatness, let alone another NBA championship, in their own 
city, but boy were they wrong!
